Usage: rhc setup 

Connects to an OpenShift server to get you started. Will help you configure your
SSH keys, set up a domain, and check for any potential problems with Git or SSH.

Any options you pass to the setup command will be stored in a
.openshift/express.conf file in your home directory. If you run setup at a later
time, any previous configuration will be reused.

Pass the --clean option to ignore your saved configuration and only use options
you pass on the command line. Pass --config FILE to use default values from
another config (the values will still be written to .openshift/express.conf).

If the server supports authorization tokens, you may pass the --create-token
option to instruct the wizard to generate a key for you.

If you would like to enable tab-completion in Bash shells, pass --autocomplete
for more information.
